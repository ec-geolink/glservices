# GeoLink Services

> Simple service API's for accessing the GeoLink triple store

## Background
This is mostly a set of sandbox services to allow for further discussions with groups
interested in exploring the use of GeoLink in thier efforts.

## Examples
Examples will be coming.  However, we plan to implement swagger-ui relatively quickly 
in order to provide an initial interfaces.   

## Things to do:
* Enable SWAGGER UI:   ref:  https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/tree/master/swagger 
* Also should make a DOAP file for this effot.  

## Linked Data API
Need to look this over and see if this will be useful to this approach:  https://github.com/UKGovLD/linked-data-api/blob/wiki/API_Deployment_Example.md

## OpenSearch
Do we want the RESTful API to follow OpenSearch patterns?  (likely yes, at least at the start)
